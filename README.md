# autohotkey-On-fly-window-hot-key
Assign hot key to windows or programs


## Motivation

Sometime you need to keep an editor but switch between different chrome browsers to test some code to see how it can work as different user. For example you may need to swith between different Google chrome window to simulate admin and user and visitor. It can be confusing because all chrome window looks same. At this point to can assign a hot key to each window to swith betwen them without even looking at task bar. 

## Installation

Install Autohotkey software and run the script.

## Tests

Activate your first chrome profile that you want to use for search and press WIN+Shift+1. This assigns Win+1 key to this window.
Activate your second chrome profile that you want to use as admin and press WIN+Shift+2. This assigns Win+2 key to this window.
Activate your third chrome profile that you want to use as loggedin user and press WIN+Shift+3. This assigns Win+3 key to this window.
Activate your forth chrome profile that you want to use as loggedin user and press WIN+Shift+4. This assigns Win+4 key to this window.

Now you can hide show each window by pressing assined hot key.
